# AWS EC2 Controller Discord Bot
This is still a large WIP, currently being used to turn a Feed the Beast server on and off from Discord. End goal is to have a larger amount of commands, easier integration with your own AWS account and not having just one hard coded instance.

## Tools Used
* Python 3 and pip3
* AWS CLI : ```pip3 install awscli ```
* AWS BOTO library : ``` pip3 install boto3 ```
* Discord Bot library : ``` pip3 install discord ```

## Usage | Installation
1. Install and setup the required tools above
2. Setup AWS CLI with ``` aws configure ```
3. Go to Discord's developer site and setup a bot [here](https://discordapp.com/developers)
4. Clone this repo into a desired folder
5. Change the instance ID in bot.py to your desired instance
6. Set the discord token environment variable with the name 'AWSDISCORDTOKEN'
7. Set the discord guild id in environment variable 'AWSDISCORDGUILD'
8. python3 bot.py :)

For easy and reliable usage I reccomend using upstart to restart on error and start on system startup
